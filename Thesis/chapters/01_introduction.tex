Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are specialized hardware that can manipulate large amounts of data in a highly parallel manner.
The hardware's main purpose is processing graphical data, however modern use of GPUs is in the form of general-pupose computing on the GPU (GPGPU) where we exploit the GPUs many cores to run computations normally run on CPUs in parallel.

This high performance GPU computing has become very accessible via high level frameworks, which provide a limited set of operators, such as stencil, permute, fold, scan, which can manipulate data on a GPU \cite{chakravarty2011accelerating}.
However, in most cases the compiled assembly has inefficient memory accesses with lower cache hit rates and uncoalesced accesses than manually tweaked code.
Threads can be scheduled in such a way to minimize these inefficiencies.
In such cases, a smarter scheduler can achieve better cache and memory utilization \cite{nugteren2014study}.
We propose a simple schedule to improve performance by leveraging the structure of memory accesses in the high level GPGPU framework Accelerate \cite{chakravarty2011accelerating}.

\section{Motivation}

\section{Contributions}
This thesis shows that the cache with tiled implementations for stencil and matrix multiplication can be improved by rescheduling via index mapping.
While the main focus lies in improving the performance on GPU, the techniques presented can also be applied on a CPU.

The main contributions of this thesis are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item An analysis for the theoretical cache utilization and efficiency of both linear and multithreaded (GPU) execution for naive and tiled implementations of stencil and matrix multiplication operations.
    \item A simple implementeable schedule for stencil and matrix multiplication operations that better utilize the cache, which results in equal or better performance than the naive and tiled implementation.
    \item An analysis for the theoretical cache utilization and efficiency of a column-based scheduler.
\end{itemize}
